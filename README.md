This CI/CD pipeline flowchart showcases an automated deployment process using Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker. Code changes are pushed from the developerâ€™s local environment to GitHub, where a webhook triggers Jenkins to pull the latest code, build a Docker image, and run tests. Jenkins then uses Ansible for configuration management, deploying the Docker container to the specified environment. This setup ensures consistent, scalable, and automated delivery, allowing developers to rapidly release updates with minimal manual intervention.
